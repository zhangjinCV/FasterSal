The open source address of our manuscript **FasterSal: Robust and Real-time Single-Stream Architecture for RGB-D Salient Object Detection**, for the time being, we only provide the result maps as well as the test methods, and wait until we receive it to open up all the code.
 
# Result Maps
Our predicted maps on RGBD SOD datasets can be found at [BaiDu Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11JjNX8BCjQkoZHvT3cpJpQ?pwd=Fast) and [Google Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hsRvbdfTd0vl8DqJuSAqAoztN1TOr-Yt/view?usp=drive_link)
