The open source address of our manuscript **FasterSal: Robust and Real-time Single-Stream Architecture for RGB-D Salient Object Detection**, for the time being, we only provide the result maps as well as the test methods, and wait until we receive it to open up all the code.
 
*Result Maps*
Our predicted maps on RGBD SOD datasets can be find at [BaiDu Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11JjNX8BCjQkoZHvT3cpJpQ?pwd=Fast)
